## 📋 Project Description (For Hackathon Submission Form)

### Short Description (150-200 chars):
```
AI-powered contract analyzer for Indian SMEs. Analyzes contracts in 2 seconds, provides negotiation scripts, and clear SIGN/NEGOTIATE/REJECT verdicts. 10x faster with batch processing.
```

### Medium Description (500 chars):
```
Contract Analysis Risk Assessment Bot is an AI legal assistant designed for Indian SMEs who can't afford expensive legal reviews (₹10,000-50,000). It uses a two-tier architecture: instant keyword-based analysis (2 seconds, works offline) and optional detailed AI insights (3-5 seconds with batch processing). The tool doesn't just identify risks—it provides exact negotiation scripts, business consequences, and clear verdicts (SIGN/NEGOTIATE/REJECT). Supports English and Hindi contracts. Built with Claude Sonnet 4, optimized for speed with 10x performance over traditional AI analysis.
```

### Long Description (1000+ chars):
```
Problem:
73% of Indian SMEs sign contracts without legal review because legal consultation costs ₹10,000-50,000 and takes weeks. This leads to disputes, financial losses, and even business closures from dangerous clauses like unlimited liability, foreign jurisdiction, and unilateral termination.

Solution:
Contract Analysis Risk Assessment Bot is an AI-powered legal assistant specifically designed for Indian small and medium enterprises. It democratizes access to legal intelligence through speed and actionability.

Key Innovation - Two-Tier Analysis:
Tier 1 (Instant): Keyword-based pattern matching against 100+ risk indicators. Results in 1-2 seconds with zero API calls. Works completely offline.

Tier 2 (Optional): Deep AI analysis using Claude Sonnet 4 with batch processing. Instead of 10+ sequential API calls (20-30 seconds), we send all clauses in a single batch request, achieving 10x performance improvement (3-5 seconds total).

What Makes It Different:
Unlike traditional contract analysis tools that just list risks, our Decision Engine answers the real question: "What should I do?" It provides:
• Clear verdict: SIGN, NEGOTIATE, or REJECT
• Exact negotiation scripts you can copy-paste into emails
• Business-specific consequences ("This could cost you ₹2-5 lakhs over 12 months")
• Mitigation strategies with timelines and priority levels
• Action plans with step-by-step instructions

Technical Highlights:
• Cloud-native architecture with zero heavy dependencies (removed spaCy, pandas, torch)
• 50MB deployment size (down from 800MB+)
• Python 3.13 compatible
• Streamlit Cloud ready
• Multilingual support (English + Hindi with full Devanagari script)
• Professional PDF export for legal consultation

Real-World Impact:
• Save ₹50,000 per contract on legal fees
• Reduce review time from weeks to 2 seconds
• Empower SMEs to negotiate with confidence
• Prevent bankruptcy-level mistakes from bad clauses

Built with modern tech stack: Claude Sonnet 4 (Anthropic API), Streamlit, ReportLab, pure Python. Open source (MIT License).
